<h1>Does Pre-Movie Hype and Investment Predict Box Office Results?</h1>
<p>06/22/2019</p>

<p></p>

<p>Can you use general information about a film along with sentiment of tweets and critic reviews to determine how a movie will perform at the box office? This review was limited to three film universes, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and the Star Wars Universe and only included films released in the last five years.</p>
<p>Overall, we werenâ€™t that successful in predicating box office results, partly because our selection of films was small (only 21) and this resulted in some categorical variables having a limited number of observations making the regression results not statistically significant. Based on our regression results, we predicted the next film, Spiderman Homecoming will have a worldwide gross of $611,549,260 when it is released in July.</p>
<p>We recommend that this data be continually added to as new franchise films are released to increase its predictive power. Additionally, if the regression results suggest a movie may underperform expectations, we recommend that the studio involved review the reasons why (i.e. month) and determine if the potential downside is worth changing the release date.</p>
