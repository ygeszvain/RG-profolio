<h1>Data Science Project in Sales Analysis</h1>
<p>02/23/2020</p>

<p></p>

<p>Corey Oil, LTD. is an oil distributor/wholesaler located in Wisconsin. 40 years of oil selling history has contributed a highly loyal customer group. The dedication to providing product service, knowledge, and competitive prices promotes excellent customer relationship and stable selling history. However, the challenge is to identify the strength of the products. For example, what type of oil is selling and what products are not.</p>
<p>The project aims to utilize data science tools to perform statistical analysis on a sales history dataset. The analytical result is insightful in ways including product analytics, solvency analytics, opportunities, and potential losses</p>
