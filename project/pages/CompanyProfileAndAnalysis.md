title: Company Sales and Procurement Analysis
date: 09/25/2018

Corey Oil, LTD. is an oil distributor/wholesaler located in Wisconsin. 40 years of oil selling history has contributed a highly loyal customer group. The dedication to providing product service, knowledge, and competitive prices promotes excellent customer relationship and stable selling history. However, the challenge is to identify the strength of the products. For example, what type of oil is selling and what products are not.
This group project aims to prepare and collect a dataset that is valuable for data and business analysis. The goal of the project is to turn the data into valuable proposals and suggestions via descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, and quantitative analytics.
